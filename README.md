# china's daily vaccination update
Scraping daily vaccination data from China's National Health Commission and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and plotting the chart to show the vaccination data. 

## Data source
The historical data of vaccination comes from China's [National Health Commission](http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqjzqk/list_gzbd.shtml) and later from the [CDC](https://www.chinacdc.cn/jkzt/crb/zl/szkb_11803/jszl_12208/). As China only reports the total number of vaccinations, the daily vaccination number is calculated by comparing the daily discrepancy.
